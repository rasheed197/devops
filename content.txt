🚀 DevOps Journey — Filters & I/O Redirection in Linux

Today I learned how Linux filters and I/O redirection work — powerful concepts for processing data directly from the terminal.

🔍 Filter Commands
These commands help process and manipulate text streams:

grep → search for text patterns in files
less → view output one page at a time
head → display the beginning of a file
tail → display the end of a file
cut → extract specific fields from text
awk → advanced text filtering & transformation
Text search & replace using vim and sed

🔄 I/O Redirection
Control where input, output, and errors go:

> → redirect output (overwrite)
>> → redirect output (append)
< → redirect input
2> → redirect errors (overwrite)
2>> → redirect errors (append)
&> → redirect output + error (overwrite)
&>> → redirect output + error (append)
| → pipe output of one command to another
> /dev/null → discard output (redirect to nowhere)

🎯 Takeaway
Filters and redirection make Linux incredibly powerful for log analysis, automation, and scripting — key skills for DevOps and system administration.

Still learning. Still documenting. 🚀
