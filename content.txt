🚀 DevOps Journey — Package Management in Linux



Yesterday I learned how package management works in Linux and why higher-level package managers are preferred over raw installation commands.



📦 Linux distributions mainly fall into two families:



• RPM-based (RHEL, CentOS, Rocky, Amazon Linux)

• Debian-based (Ubuntu, Debian)

🔍 Viewing Installed Packages

RPM-based:

$ rpm -qa



Debian-based:

$ dpkg -l



⚙️ Installing & Uninstalling RPM Packages using RPM command

$ rpm -ivh package_name.rpm  # install

$ rpm -e package_name     # uninstall



❌ Problem with RPM:

If the package has dependencies (e.g. httpd), installation fails unless you manually install all required dependencies first — which can be very tedious.



🛠️ Linux Provides Better Package Management Tools

• yum

• dnf

• apt



✅ Why they’re better:

They automatically resolve and install dependencies along with the main package.


📥 Installing Packages with yum / dnf

yum install package_name

dnf install package_name

🎯 Takeaway

While rpm is useful, real-world system administration and DevOps rely on yum, dnf, and apt for reliable, dependency-aware package management.



Still learning. Still documenting. 🚀
