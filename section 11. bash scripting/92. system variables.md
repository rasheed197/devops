# SYSTEM VARIABLES

`$?` means the exit code.

If we run a command `free -m` and then the command `$?`, we get 0. This means the `free -m` command gave an exit code of 0.

```
$ free -m

$ $?

#OUTPUT
0
```

Let's assume we made a syntax error which gave us an error, we'll get a non zero exit code

```
$ freee -m

$ $?

#OUTPUT
127
```
OR

```
$ free -mabcd

$ $?

#OUTPUT
1
```

Basically what this means is, if you get 0, the last command was a success, but if you get a non zero, the last command failed.

We also have few more system VARIBLES like

```
$ echo $USER

$ echo $HOSTNAME

$ echo $RANDOM  # gives us a random numer
```
