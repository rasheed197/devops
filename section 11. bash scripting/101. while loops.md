# WHILE LOOPS 

As `for loop` runs for a sequence, `while loop` runs for a condition. As long as the condition is true, it will keep running the code which is mentioned in the while block.

### Syntax

```
while [ [CONDITION] ]
do
  [COMMANDS]
done
```

### Example 1
```
#while.sh 

#!/bin/bash

counter=0

echo "Looping"
while [ $counter -le 5 ]
do
  echo "Value of counter is $counter."
  counter=$(( $counter + 1 ))
  sleep 1
done

echo "Out of the loop."
```

### Example 2
```
#2_while.sh 

#!/bin/bash

counter=0
continue=true

echo "Looping"
while $continue
do
  echo "Value of counter is $counter."
  counter=$(( $counter + 1 ))
  sleep 1

  if [ $counter -ge 5 ]
  do
    continue=false
  fi
done

echo "Out of the loop."
```
