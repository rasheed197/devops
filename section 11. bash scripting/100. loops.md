# LOOPS

Running something again and again and again...

There are 2 kinds of loops in bash scripting, `for` and `while` loop.

for loop runs for a definitive number of times. It's basically going to run on a sequence, a list of something.

### Syntax

```
for [VAR] in [SEQUENCE]
do
    [COMMANDS]
done
```

### Example 1
```
#1_for.sh

#!/bin/bash

echo "Looping..."
for var1 in java .net python ruby php
do
  sleep 1
  echo "##########################"
  echo "Value for var1 is $var1"
  echo "##########################"

  date
  echo
done
```

### Example 2
```
#2_for.sh

#!/bin/bash

MYUSERS="alpha beta gamma"

for user in $MYUSERS
do
  echo "Adding user $user"
  useradd $user
  id $user
  echo "#######################"
done
```

Run the file 

```
$ chmod +x 1_for.sh
$ chmod +x 2_for.sh

$ ./1_for.sh
$ ./2_for.sh
```
