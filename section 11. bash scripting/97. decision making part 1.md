# DECISION MAKING PART 1

## `if` Condition

Srings and numbers comparison operators are shown at the bottom

### Syntax

```
if [ [CONDITONS] ]
then
  [COMMANDS]
fi
```

If the `[CONDITION]` is true, it executes our `[COMMANDS]`, else it does not execute our `[COMMANDS]`.

```
#if_else.sh

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a numer: " NUM
echo

if [ $NUM -gt 100 ]
then
  echo "We have entered an IF block."
  sleep 3
  echo "Your number is greater than 100"
  echo
  date
fi

echo "Script execution completed successfully."
```

Run the code 

```
$ chmod +x 1_if.sh

$ ./1_if.sh
```

What if we wanted to execute something else If the `[CONDITION]` is false. For this we can put an `else` block

```
#if_else.sh

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a numer: " NUM
echo

if [ $NUM -gt 100 ]
then
  echo "We have entered an IF block."
  sleep 3
  echo "Your number is greater than 100"
  echo
  date
else
  echo "You have entered number less than 100"
fi

echo "Script execution completed successfully."
```

### String Comparisons

```
=       compare if two strings are equal

==      compare if two strings are equal

!=      compare if two strings are not equal. 

>       compare if one sting is greater than another 
        string, in ASCII alphabetical order. 

<       compare if one string is less than
        another string, in ASCII alphabetical order

-n      evaluate if string length is greater than zero.
        if [-n $a]

-z      evaluate if string length is equal to zero. 
        if [-z $a]
```

### Number Comparisons

```
-eq     compare if two numbers are equal.

-ge     compare if one number is greater than or equal to 
        a number.

-le     compare if one number is less than or equal to a 
        number.

-ne     compare if two numbers are not equal. 

-gt     compare if one number is greater than another 
        number.

-lt     compare if one number is less than another 
```
