# COMMAND SUBSTITUTION 

This is useful for writing some intelligent script. 

What command substitution really does is that it takes the output of a command and stores it into the variable.

We can achieve this by using backticks `` or $().

If you put a command in `` or $(), then it's going to take the output of the command and stores it into the variable.

### Example

If we use quotes, we only get the command back
```
$ UP="uptime"
$ echo $UP

#OUTPUT
uptime
```

But if we use backticks `` or $() we get the output of the command 

```
$ UP=`uptime`
$ echo $UP

#OUTPUT
22:25:37 up 3 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.34, 0.72, 0.35


$ CURRENT_USER=$(who)
$ echo $CURRENT_USER

#OUTPUT
vagrant  pts/0        2025-12-12 22:25 (10.0.2.2)

```
