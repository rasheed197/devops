# DECISION MAKING PART 2

### `elif` Condition

`elif` are used for checking multiple conditions.

Strings and numbers comparison operators are shown at the bottom.

### Syntax

```
if [ [CONDITONS] ];
then
  [COMMANDS]
elif [ [CONDITONS] ]
  [COMMANDS]
else
  [COMMANDS]
fi
```

Let's say we want to know how many network interface are there, ignoring the first first one which is a loopback.

```
$ ip addr show | grep -v LOOPBACK | grep -ic mtu

#OUTPUT
2
```

```
#if_elif.sh

#!/bin/bash

value=$(ip addr show | grep -v LOOPBACK | grep -ic mtu)

if [ $value -eq 1 ]
then
  echo "1 Active Network Interface Found."
elif [ $value -gt 1 ]
  echo "Found Multiple Active Interface"
else
  echo "No Active Interface Found"
fi
```

Run the code 

```
$ chmod +x if_elif.sh

$ ./if_elif.msh
```

### String Comparisons

```
=       compare if two strings are equal

==      compare if two strings are equal

!=      compare if two strings are not equal. 

>       compare if one sting is greater than another 
        string, in ASCII alphabetical order. 

<       compare if one string is less than
        another string, in ASCII alphabetical order

-n      evaluate if string length is greater than zero.
        if [-n $a]

-z      evaluate if string length is equal to zero. 
        if [-z $a]
```

### Number Comparisons

```
-eq     compare if two numbers are equal.

-ge     compare if one number is greater than or equal to 
        a number.

-le     compare if one number is less than or equal to a 
        number.

-ne     compare if two numbers are not equal. 

-gt     compare if one number is greater than another 
        number.

-lt     compare if one number is less than another
