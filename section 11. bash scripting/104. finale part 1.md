# FINALE PART 1


We're going to do web setup in the script, but so far we've been running the script on the scriptbox VM itself.

Now we're going to run the script on the web01, web02, and web03. 

Create a directory `remote_websetup` in `/opt/scripts/` 

```
$ mkdir remote_websetup

$ vim remote_hosts

#CONTENT 
web01
web02 
web03
```

If you're using IP address give the list of IP addresses, or if you can give hostnames, if you've already configured it the host file.

We login into the 3 servers using the command below, and ran the `hostname` command on each machine

```
$ for host in `cat remote_host`; do ssh devops@$host hostname; done

#OUTPUT
web01
web02 
web03
```

Now that we can communicate with the remote machine at once. Now let's setup website on them using the script `multios_websetup.sh`
