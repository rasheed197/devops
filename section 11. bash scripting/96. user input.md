# USER INPUT

How can we make our script interactive, taking input from the user and then execute the script?

This can be done by using the command `read` and the variable name, i.e `read var1`

When you execute a script which has a `read` statement, it'll wait for the user input, user enters a value, it'll be stored into the variable, and then we can use the variable.

```
#user_input.sh

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter your skills:"
read SKILL

echo "Your $SKILL skill is in high demand in the IT Indudtry."

read -p 'Username: ' USR
read -sp 'Password: ' pass

echo 

echo "Login successful: Welcome USER $USR"
```

Run the file 

```
$ chmod +x user_input.sh

$ ./user_input.sh
```

But it's really not recommended in DevOps atleast, to make the script interactive because we run our scrpt from background from some other tools. 
And we really don't want user to interact with the system. Because user interraction is always error prone.
