# INTRODUCTION TO LINUX

## OPEN SOURCE
- When we say a software is open source, we don't mean the software is free of charge.
- It means the code is freely available to anybody to inspect, modify, enhance, and then redistribute
- So if you are creating a software and you made it open source, you can expect people around the world to contribute to your software, make it much more better, more secure, and more enhamced
- that way other people also become contributor to your open source project

## LINUX HISTORY
- Linux is an open source OS/Kernel 

### LINUX ORIGINS
- In 1984, the open source version of UNI X utilities came in.
- It was distributed under GPL license.
- In 1991, Linus Torvalds, who literally changed everything in the IT industry
- He created a UNI X-like kernel (also called linux kernel)  and made it open source.
When we say UNI X-like kernel we mean a kernel similar to UNI X
- Also ships with it some GNU utilities (the tools).
- After that, brilliant mind around the world started using that kernel (which is called as linux kernel) and started developing some utilities around it to create a complete OS.
```
Linux kernel + GNU utilities = complete, open source, UNI X-like OS
```
- In todays time, when you talk about Linux OS like CentOS, Ubuntu, Kali linux, Debian, Red Hat Linux.
- They are using the same Linux kernel (though it's upgraded now)
- So let's say Rd Hat has took that kernel and created its own utilities, packaging system, and created an complete OS which we call Red Hat Linux
- There are also 
    - Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    - CentOS Linux
    - Fedora Linux
    - Ubuntu (created by Canonical)
    - Debian
    - openSUSE etc
- Now there are lots and lots of Linux OS, Android phone is Linux

## LINUX PRINCIPLES
- In linux, everything is considered as a file 
    - including the hardware, mouse, keyboard, printer
- We mostly have small simple purpose program
    - we rarely have bulky programs
- Ability to chain this program together to perform complex operations
- We avoid captive user interface in Linux
    - we don't like the graphical softwares
    - if you open a software or any tool, and it's waiting for user input, 
    - that means it has captured the user interface 
    - i.e the user has to be there and click or write something so the program can continue 
    - we're going to avoid that
    - otherwise it'll be difficult to run such things in the background or automate such things
- Configuration data are stored in text file in Linux
    - this makes it very easy to make changes to the file
    - so we can easily changes to the settings
    - no need to start navigating to settings, tabs, advanced tabs etc.

## WHY LINUX
- It's open source
- Huge community support, you get new updates
- Supports wide variety of hardware, it runs on phones, laptops, servers etc
- There's lot of customization you can do
- Most servers out there are running Linux operating system
- Automation is so easy to do Linux compared to Windows
- Linux is considers as a secured operating system compared to Microsoft Windows.

## ARCHITECTURE OF LINUX
#### 1. HARDWARE
- This is your computer resource e.g RAM, CPU, network etc

#### 2. KERNEL
- On top of the hardware we have the kernel
- Now on your Linux OS, you have the linux kernel 
- linux kernel will read and understand the hardware and can pass signal to and through your hardware to shell

#### 3. SHELL 
- From shell you can execute comands, and expect a return 

#### 4. OTHER TOOLS
Also you should have a lot of tools built around your linux kernel which you can use 
- starting from very simple commands like "cd, vi, cat, ls, grep, date"
- all the way to graphical softwares like "browsers, PDF readers"
- Users will connect to this tools, which in turn will send the information to the kernel

## POPULAR LINUX DISTROS
### POPULAR DESKTOP LINUX os
- Ubuntu Linux (most popular)
- Linux Mint
- Arch Linux
- Fedora (from Red Hat)
- Debian
- OpenSuse

### POPULAR SERVER LINUX OS
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
    - most popular, stable and secure OS
    - it's not open source. There's licensing fot it.
- Ubuntu Server
    - also popular
    - it's open source
- CentOS
    - similar to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 
    - but it's open source
- SUSE Enterprise Linux

- To seee more you can check wikipedia for "list of linux distributions". 
- but these are the most popular ones

## MOST USED LINUX DISTROS CURRENTLY IN IT INDUSTRY
- RPM based: RHEL, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Amazon Linux
- Debian based: Ubuntu Server, Kali Linux

- The major difference between these two family of OS is the packaging method of the software
    - RPM software is packaged in RPM format e.g exe, msi, apk, etc
    - Debian software is packaged in DEB format
    - RPM will have softwares that ends with .rpm
    - Debian will have softwares that ends with .deb
- There commands are different e.g 
```
# install package in RPM
rpm -ivh PACKAGE_NAME

# install package in Debian
dpkg -i PACKAGE_NAME
```
- There file names are different

## WHICH SHOULD BE USED WHEN
### RPM BASED
- Red Hat is considered as stable and secure OS. Expecially RHEL
- You should not download and install software in RHEL Linux from outside.
- You download it only from Red Hat repository
- So Red Hat is going to test all the softwares and packages (just like Apple) for and security or performance flaw before it releases it to its users.
- Good for server based, for running servers

### DEBIAN BASED
- Here you get lots of software very easily
- the softwares are very easy to install and setup
- focuses more on user friendliness
- so if you need latest and greatest in open source software you go with debian based like Ubuntu
- Good for DevOps based, for automation purposes
    - you may need latest libraries and softwares to do some automations
    - you don't want to run into software installation problems

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE IN LINUX
### 1. Home Directories
- root user is the admin user, all-powerful yser in linux
```
# root user directory
/root

# normal user directory
/home/username
```

### 2. User Executable
- user executable commands like ls, cat, pwd etc
- these commands are located in user executable directories
- these commands can only be executed by normal user
```
# user executable directories
/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
```

### 3. System Executable
- these commands can only be executed by root user
- e.g installing a software (using rpm, or dpkg command), apt command, user add command etc
- these commands are located in system executable directories
```
# system executable directories
/sbin
/usr/sbin
/usr/local/sbin
```
### 4. Other mountpoints
- if you connect soe external device like  USB drive, or CD.
- it will be automatically mounted either on /media or /mnt
```
# mount points
/media
/mnt
```

### 5. Configuration data
- stored in /etc
- e.g network configuration, server configuration, user configuration etc
- all user information are located in /etc/passwd
```
# configuration data
/etc
```

### 6. Temporary Files
- any temporary data you want to keep, you can put it in /tmp
- there's a chance of that file getting deleted when you reboot
```
# temporary files
/tmp
```

### 7. Kernel and Bootloader
- located in /boot
```
# kernel and bootloader
/boot
```

### 8. Server data
- like web servers you're running
- website files you're going to put them in /var/www/html
- MySQL data in /var/lib/mysql
- Log files are located in /var/log
- System log file are located in /var/log/messages
```
# server data
/var
/srv
```

### 9. System Information
```
# system information
/proc 
/sys
```

### 10. Shared / Popular Libraries
```
# popular libraries
/lib
/usr/lib
/usr/local/lib
```
