# GIT SSH LOGIN

```
$ cat .git/config

...
[remote "origin"]
        url = https://github.com/rasheed197/titanwork.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "main"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/main
```

From the command below we see that there's an https url and our authentication will be based on usernames and password, which really not a good idea, because there are chances of exposing the password.

So github provides also ssh based login and almost every remote git repository provides ssh based authentications, which will be through ssh keys. 

So first you need to generate the ssh keys.
```
$ ssh-keygen.exe
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/HP/.ssh/id_ed25519):
...
Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/HP/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/HP/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
...
```

This will generate the public and private key in the path "/c/Users/HP/.ssh/"

```
$ cd /c/Users/HP/.ssh/

$ ls

id_ed25519  id_ed25519.pub
```

So the public key is in id_ed25519.pub, while the private key is in id_ed25519. So we'll put the public key content on github.
```
$ cat id_ed25519.pub

ssh-ed25519 ... HP@DESKTOP-OMEFLDD
```

In your github account go to location below, enter the title and public key, then click add "Add SSH key"
```
Settings ---> SSH and GPG keys ---> New SSH key
```

Now when you want to clone your repos, you should use the SSH url and not the HTTPS url

If your repo is a private repo it will match the public key in github with the private key in your computer. If it matches, it is going to clone the repo without asking for any username or password.

So this is considered as a safer login, SSH login on git repositories compared to https login.
