# The pwd command in Linux stands for "print working directory." 

# Its primary function is to display the full, absolute path of the current 
# directory you are located in within the filesystem. 

# This path starts from the root directory (/) and lists all subsequent directories 
# leading to your current location, separated by slashes (/).
