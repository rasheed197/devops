# CONTINOUS INTEGRATION

- Continous integration is an automated process in DevOps which generates software and its features quickly and efficiently.
- Developers write several lines of codes while creating a software 
- It is an ideal practice to store all this code in a centralised place
- this centralised repository is called a version control system like GitHub
- Developers will pull and push codes to such repositories several times in a day
- So code changes/commit happens several times in aday
- This code will be moved to build server
- On build server, this code will be build, tested and evaluated, which generates the Software, or we call it Arttifacts at this stage
- Artifact or software is really an archive of files generated from the build process.
- Based on the programming language, this artifact will be packaged in a specific format.
- Artifact packaging format could be
    - WAR / JAR in Java
    - DLL / EXE / MSI in Windows
    - ZIP / TAR
- From repository it will be shipped or deployed to servers for further testing by software testers
- once they approved, it can be shipped to production servers

## PROBLEMS
- Developers created a software model and have worked for let's say 3 weeks straight
- All this code will be fetched by build server, and this code is build and tested
- Unfortunately there are lots of errors, bugs, conflicts, build failures
- Now developers have to fix all these defects, have to rewrite the code at several places.
- That's a lot of work.
- This could have been much easier if the problem was detected very early in the process

## SOLUTION
- A very simple and continous process
- After every single commit from developers, the code should be build and tested
- so no waiting and collecting all this codes with bugs
- But then developers commit several times a in a day, so it's not humanly possible to do a build and release several times in a day
- manually that is. So we have to automate it
- so when developers commit any code, the automated process will fetch the code, build it, test it, and send a notification if there's any failure
- as soon as the developers receive a failed notification, he/she will fix the code and commit it again
- new changes is build and tested, if it's good then it can be versioned and stored in a software repository
- this atomated process is called CONTINOUS INTEGRATION or CI in short
- CI process
    - code    
    - fetch    
    - build    
    - test     
    - notify   
    - feedback (Then back to code)
- the goal of CI is to detect at very early stage so it does not multiply.

## TOOLS
### IDE
- Eclipse
- Visual Studio
- Atom
- Pycharm etc

this IDE will be integrated with version control store and version the code.

### VERSION CONTROL
- GIT
- SVN
- TFS
- PERFORCE etc

### BUILD TOOLS BASED ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
- MAVEN, ANT, GRADLE
- MSBUILD, VISUAL BUILD
- IBM URBAN CODE
- MAKE
- GRUNT

### SOFTWARE REPOSITORY TO STORE ARTIFACTS
- SONATYPE NEXUS
- JFROG ARTIFACT
- ARCHIVA
- CLOUDSMITH PACKAGE
- GRUNT

### CI TOOLS THAT INTEGRATES EVERYTHING
- JENKINS
- CIRCLECI
- TEAM CITY
- BAMBOO CI
- CRUISE CONTROL

### CI LIFECYCLE
- Code (Developers commit code)
- Code Build (Deployable software: Artifacts)
- Code Test (Unit and integration test)
- Code Analysis (Vulnerability, best practices)
