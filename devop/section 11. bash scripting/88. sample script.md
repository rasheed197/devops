# SAMPLE SCRIPT

Want to set up a website using HTTPD service like we did in the **vagrant and liux server servers** section, but we want to do it using bash script.

The code is in `websetup.sh`

Run file

```
#give execute permission to file
$ chmod +x /opt/scripts/websetup.sh

#relative path
$ ./websetup.sh

#absolute path
$ /opt/scripts/websetup.sh

#get vm ip
$ ip addr show
```

Paste the IP in a browser to see the website.
