# QUOTES

We have 2 types of quotes in bash
- Double quotes 
- Single quotes

### HOW ARE THEY THE SAME
```
$ SKILL="DevOps"
$ echo $SKILL

#OUTPUT
DevOps

$ SKILL='DevOps'
$ echo $SKILL

#OUTPUT
DevOps
```

### HOW THEY DIFFER
```
$ SKILL="DevOps"
$ echo "I have got $SKILL skill."

#OUTPUT
I have got DevOps skill.

$ SKILL='DevOps'
$ echo 'I have got $SKILL skill.'

#OUTPUT
I have got $SKILL skill.
```

In double quotes the variable worked, but in single quotes, it's printing $SKILL as it is.

Single quotes removes the meaning of special character. `$` is a special character, it has a special meaning in bash, but if we put it in single quotes its special meaning is gone.

#### WHAT IF WE HAVE TO PRINT A $ AND ALSO A VARIABLE IN THE SAME SENTENCE

```
$ VIRUS='covid19'
$ echo "Due to $VIRUS, virus companies have lost $9 million."

#OUTPUT
Due to covid19, virus companies have lost million.
```

The variable $VIRUS worked, but $9 is lost in the sentence. So you see `$9` actually mean the 9th argument, but we don't want it as an argument, we want to print it as it is.

The way to fix this is wherever you have a special character, you put a basckward slash `\`. What happens is that the next character after the backward slash, if it's a special character, its meaning will be ignored

```
$ VIRUS='covid19'
$ echo "Due to $VIRUS, virus companies have lost \$9 million."

#OUTPUT
Due to covid19, virus companies have lost $9 million.
```
