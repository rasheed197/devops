# SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT

In Linux we call them PACKAGE MANAGEMENT

In Linux there are many ways of installing or setting up a package.

In previous lesson we installed two OS CentOS, and Ubuntu

The major difference between these two OS is the package management system
```
CetOS is RPM based OS

Ubuntu is Debian based OS
```

#### NOTE
yum and apt repos file are located in 
```
$ /etc/yum.repos.d/               # for yum

$ /etc/apt/sources.list           #OR

$ /etc/apt/sources.list.d         # for apt
```

### 1. SEE LIST OF RPM PACKAGES INSTALLED
```
$ rpm -qa
```

### 2. SEE LIST OF DEBIAN PACKAGES INSTALLED
```
$ dpkg -l
```

### 3. INSTALL RPM PACKAGE USING RPM COMMAND

```
Go to https://www.rpmfind.net

Search the package name you want to install (e.g telnet)

You could also search google directly for "telnet rpm" and it will take you to the site

Select the one for your system (e.g CentOS9, Fedora40, etc) and architecture (e.g arch64, ppc64le, etc)
```

See your OS information
```
$ cat /etc/os-release
```

Find the architecture of your system
```
[root@centos ~]# arch
x86_64

[root@centos ~]# uname -m
x86_64
```

Architecture is of the CPU, and if you have 64-bit CPU, you are going to install 64-bit OS and likewise you're going to install 64-bit packages.

copy the download link address and run it using "curl" or "wget"
```
curl -o telnet-0.17-85.el9.x86_64.rpm https://rpmfind.net/linux/centos-stream/9-stream/AppStream/x86_64/os/Packages/telnet-0.17-85.el9.x86_64.rpm

#OR

wget https://rpmfind.net/linux/centos-stream/9-stream/AppStream/x86_64/os/Packages/telnet-0.17-85.el9.x86_64.rpm
```

wget or curl can access a remote URL, but wget is most of the time used to download something from a remote URL.

curl has many other use cases.

#### OPTIONS
```
-o or --output: to write the binary output to a file
```
Now if you do "ls" you should see the rpm file
```
[root@centos ~]# ls

anaconda-ks.cfg  original-ks.cfg  telnet-0.17-85.el9.x86_64.rpm
```
The command to install the rpm is 
```
[root@centos ~]# rpm -ivh telnet-0.17-85.el9.x86_64.rpm
```
#### OPTIONS
```
i: for install
v: for verbose, that means print
h: for human readable format. 
```

Now if you run the command "telnet", you get the telnet shell
```
[root@centos ~]# telnet

telnet>
```

You can exist telnet by doing 
```
telnet> quit
```

Now see if telnet is in the list of installed rpm packages
```
[root@centos ~]# rpm -qa | grep telnet

telnet-0.17-85.el9.x86_64
```

### 4. UNINSTALL AN RPM PACKAGE USING RPM COMMAND
Uninstall telnet
```
rpm -e telnet-0.17-85.el9.x86_64
```
#### OPTIONS
```
e: for erase
```

#### PROBLEM WITH USING RPM COMMAND FOR INSTALLATION
If the package you are trying to install using "rpm" has dependencies (e.g httpd has 2 or more dependencies), the installation will fail unless you install those dependencies first.

```
[root@centos yum.repos.d]# rpm -ivh httpd-2.4.62-7.el9.x86_64.rpm

error: Failed dependencies:
        httpd-core = 0:2.4.62-7.el9 is needed by httpd-2.4.62-7.el9.x86_64
        system-logos-httpd is needed by httpd-2.4.62-7.el9.x86_64
```

Imagine your package having like 50 dependencies which you have to install, that will be a very hectic process.

This is a very basic method of finding the RPM and installing it, but Linux gives much more better package management systems or tools, for example "yum", "dnf", "apt".

And majority of the time you will be using them.

### 5. INSTALL RPM PACKAGE USING YUM COMMAND

If we "cd" into yum and do "ls", you will some files there. 
```
[root@centos ~]# cd /etc/yum.repos.d/

[root@centos yum.repos.d]# ls
centos-addons.repo  centos.repo
```

"cat" into any of this files
```
[root@centos yum.repos.d]# cat centos.repo

[baseos]
name=CentOS Stream $releasever - BaseOS
metalink=https://mirrors.centos.org/metalink?repo=centos-baseos-$stream&arch=$basearch&protocol=https,http
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-centosofficial
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=0
metadata_expire=6h
countme=1
enabled=1

...
```

Inside any of these files you will see repositories

You will see the URL (metalink), name of the repositories, if it's enabled or not, and few other informations.

So default repositories access comes with the OS when you install the OS. Some you can add to get access to more softwares.

How this works is you do
```
[root@centos yum.repos.d]# yum search httpd
```

And this will search through all the available repositories and give you the list of all the package that has the name "httpd"
```
[root@centos yum.repos.d]# yum search httpd

Last metadata expiration check: 6 days, 22:25:15 ago on Thu 06 Nov 2025 10:13:21 AM UTC.
================================ Name Exactly Matched: httpd ================================
httpd.x86_64 : Apache HTTP Server

================================ Name & Summary Matched: httpd ================================
centos-logos-httpd.noarch : CentOS-related icons and pictures used by httpd
httpd-core.x86_64 : httpd minimal core
...
```

We want to install the Apache HTTP Server, so we do 
```
[root@centos yum.repos.d]# yum install httpd
```

This will install the httpd package as well as all its dependencies

### 6. INSTALL RPM PACKAGE USING DNF COMMAND

Now a new generation tool is DNF for RPM based OS.

We can also install httpd using DNF
```
[root@centos ~]# dnf install httpd
```

So you can use "yum" or "dnf" alternatively, but most of the time try to use dnf, it's a new generation command.

### 7. UNINSTALL RPM PACKAGE USING DNF COMMAND
```
[root@centos ~]# dnf remove httpd
```
This will also remove the dependencies installed if it's not used by any other packages.

You can also skip the interactve question where it asks you if you're sure you want to install or uninstall by using the -y option 
```
[root@centos ~]# yum install httpd -y 

[root@centos ~]# dnf install httpd -y 

[root@centos ~]# dnf remove httpd -y
```

To see other available options for yum or dnf, use the --help option
```
[root@centos ~]# dnf --help
[root@centos ~]# yum --help
```

#### DNF OTHER OPTIONS
```
check-update: check for available package upgrades

clean: remove cached data

reinstall: reinstall a package. If it didn't install properly the first time

remove: remove a package(s)

upgrade: upgrade a package(s)
```

### 8. WHAT IF THE PACKAGE IS NOT AVAILABLE?
What if the package is not available in any of the repositories yum has access to
```
[root@centos yum.repos.d]# yum install jenkins

Last metadata expiration check: 4:22:11 ago on Thu 13 Nov 2025 08:47:07 AM UTC.
No match for argument: jenkins
Error: Unable to find a match: jenkins
```

#### WHAT DO YOU DO?
You search the package online.

Search "install jenkins" on google
```
URL: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing
```

The vendor of the Jenkins package will give you the step by step guide on how install its package

Select your OS and you should see the commands you need to install jenkins.

### 9. COMMON DNF COMMANDS
```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dnf --help                                  see all available dnf options

dnf search PACKAGE                          Search from available repositories

dnf install epel-release                    gives you access to more and new repositories

dnf history                                 shows you all dnf commands you have ran
```
