# APPLY BEST PRACTICES

If you want to test the script, you can either copy the scrip to your VM and run it. Or you can use the sync folder /c/vagrant-vms/[VM NAME].

Today we'll learn some new things. Open the file `websetup.sh`, select all the code, open the copilot chat <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd> or <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>. Let's ask copilot to improve the code -> `improve the code according to developmental best practices.`

If there are any code you don't understand you can use the `/explain` option in the chat.

Once agin select all the code, and ask copilot to add more functions.
