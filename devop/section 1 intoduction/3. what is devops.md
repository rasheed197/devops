# WHAT IS DEVOPS?

## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE

### 1ST PHASE - REQUIREMENT GATHERING AND ANALYSIS
Requirement gathering and analysis. Information will be collected like
- Product features 

- Who are the users

- How it will be used

- User requirements

- Current state of the market etc

### 2ND PHASE - PLANNING
What do we want? 
- It determines the cost and resources required for the implementation of the product 

- and also the risk associated with it

### 3RD PHASE - DESIGNING
- Aechitects will design the software based on the inputs from previous phase

- Architects will produce desihn documents

- This will be basically roadmap for the developers

### 4TH PHASE - DEVELOPMENT
This is where developers write the software code based on the design

### 5TH PHASE - SOFTWARE TESTING
- The software will be tested by software testers for any defects

- Software will be promoted to production only after fixing all the issues

### 6TH PHASE - DEPLOYMENT
- Software is deployed by the operation team to the production environment so users can start using the product

### 7TH PHASE - MAINTENANCE
- It is a balance between regular changes and uptime

## MODELS IN SDLC
1. Waterfall 

2. Agile

3. Spiral

4. Big Bang

and so on

- These models are path or roadway to reach the same destination

- As you choose a roadway based on different factors like
    - cost 
    - risk
    - time taken to reach your destination

### WATERFALL MODEL
- Each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin

- It is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well thought out in the planning

- Working software is produced very late in the lifecycle (months)

#### STEPS
- Requirement 
- Design 
- Implementation
- Testing 
- Maintenace

### AGILE MODEL
- Instead of developing all the reqirements for months, it can be divided into smaller lists

- Work on the list for 2 to 4 weeks and move on to the next list and son and so forth

- New changes/idea can be integrated in the next list/iteration

- Agile puts extra stress on the ops team
    - There'll regular code changes
    
    - These changes need to be deployed on the server so testers can conduct their testing
    
    - This happens several time in a single iteration
    
    - Deployment failure can occur due to no clear instructions

## DEV VS OPS
- Dev and Ops are all support 

- Dev is agile, all about regular and fixed changes

- Ops is ITIL-Driven, provides stable environment for the product

- There's a big wall of confusion in-between these two parties

- Developers task their code over this wall

- and Ops team responsibility is to deploy the code on the server

- Developers complain about delays in deployments

- Ops team complain about unclear instructions, and tossing their work over the wall

## DEVOPS FIXES THESE ISSUES
- DevOp fixes code delivery issues 

- Dev is agile 

- But Op is still waterfall

- In DevOps everyone works collaboratively, communicate effectively, and integrate the the entire code deliery process

- Dev teams are trained on Ops concept, so they can communicate with Ops team more effectively

- Ops team are also trained on agile concepts, so Ops can collaborate with dev team.

- And the most important factor - automations training and instructions to every team accross the board

- Automation of every taskin code delivery process like 
    - code build
    - code testing
    - software testing
    - infra changes
    - deployments etc

- The wall of confusion is brought down

- Every collaborates together
    - developers
    - testers
    - build and release team
    - sysadmin
    - db admin
    - and everyone across the board

## DEVOPS LIFECYCLE
- Code (Developers commit code)
- Code Build (Deployable software: Artifacts)
- Code Test (Unit and integration test)
- Code Analysis (Vulnerability, best practices)
- Delivery (Deploy changes to stages)
- DB/Sec Changes (Every other Ops changes)
- Software Testing (QA/Functional, Load, Performance test)
- Deploy to Prod
- Go Live (User traffic diverted to new changes)
- User Approval (User feedback)
- Keep Monitoring
