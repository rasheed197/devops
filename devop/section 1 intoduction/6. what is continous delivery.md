# CONTINOUS DELIVERY

- Continous delivery is an automated process of delivering code changes to servers quickly and efficiently at an enormous phase
- continous delivery is the extension of continous integration 
- we have seen that CI is an automation of our code build and test
- developers code commits will be automatically built and tested
- if everything is good the artifact generated from this process will be stored in software repositories
- the goal of the CI is to detect defects at very early stage so it does not multiply
- Ops team will get regular requests to deploy the artifacts generated from the CI process on servers for further testing
- Ops team with all the info they got, deploy the artifacts to the servers
- at times, the deployment also fails, which leads to higher lead time
- dev and ops team need to work together to fix such deployment failures
- in agile development, there will be regular code changes, which need to be deployed on servers for further testing
- deployment is not just about shiiping the software to the server, it's more than that.
- deployment could also mean
    - server provisioning
    - installing dependencies on server
    - configuration changes
    - network or firewall role changes
    - and then deploy the artifact to the server etc

- ops team will be flooded with such requests as CI processes will generate faster and regularly
- at the manual deployment, information will be sent to the QA team for testing
- after testing, QA team will send information back
- there's too much of human intervention and manual approval in this process

## SOLUTION
- Automate it and save your time and failures
- any and every step in deployment should be automated
    - server provisioning
    - installing dependencies on server
    - configuration changes
    - network or firewall role changes
    - and then deploy the artifact to the server etc

## AUTOMATION TOOLS
- ANSIBLE, PUPPET, CHEF for system automation
- TERRAFORM CFORMATION for cloud infrastructure automation
- JENKINS, OCTOPUS DEPLOY for CICD automation
- HELM CHARTS
- CODE DEPLOY etc

- software testing also has to be automated

## TEST AUTOMATION TOOLS
- FUNCTIONAL
- LOAD
- PERFORMANCE
- DATABASES
- NETWORK AND SECURITY etc

- so ops team write automation code for deployment
- testers will write automation code for software testing 
- and sync it with developers source code
- so now we have CI process integrated with deployment automationwhich triggers software testing
- all 3 teams and processes integrated together

## CD PROCESSES
- Delivery (Deploy changes to stages)
- DB/Sec Changes (Every other Ops changes)
- Software Testing (QA/Functional, Load, Performance test)
