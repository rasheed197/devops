# VERSIONING

cd into your c drive

```
$ cd /c/
```

create directory "gitrepos" and cd into it
```
$ mkdir gitrepos

$ cd gitrepos/
```

create repository/directory "titanwork" and cd into it
```
$ mkdir titanwork

$ cd titanwork
```

run the "git init" command. 
```
$ git init

Initialized empty Git repository in C:/gitrepos/titanwork/.git/
```

This command will create a ".git" directory in your current directory. This is going to maintain all the version all the history, all the configuration of your git repository. It will also create a branch called "master"
```
HP@DESKTOP-OMEFLDD MINGW64 /c/gitrepos/titanwork (master)
$ ls -a

./      ../     .git/
```

create some random files and directories
```
$ mkdir nebula jupiter pluto

$ touch saturn{1..10}.py
```

create a file in each directory, so git can keep track of it. Git keep track of files not directories
```
$ touch nebula/test2 jupiter/test3 pluto/tester20
```

check the current status of your repository
```
$ git status

On branch master
...
Untracked files:
...
```

Untracked files means those files wil not be considered for committing. Run the command "git add ." to start tracking them. This is called as STAGING. The "." in the command means current working directory, so it'll track all the files in that directory.
```
$ git add .
```

Now we have brought our file that have changed into staging area, but it's still not commited
```
$ git status

On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
...
    new file:   jupiter/test3
    new file:   nebula/test2
    new file:   pluto/tester20
    ...
```

Now we have "changes to be committed", to commit the changes we do
```
$ git commit -m "first file commited"

Author identity unknown
...
Run
    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity
...

```

When git is tracking it will also track who made the changes. So you have to set who is the user and what is the email of that user
```
$ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

Now this is a global settings. We have global and local settings in git.

- Local means local to this repository
- Global means for all repository

Now we can run the "git commit" command
```
$ git commit -m "first file commited"

[master (root-commit) cc6ff8f] first file commited
 13 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 jupiter/test3
 create mode 100644 nebula/test2
...
```

Now it has start to track these files
- We have 13 file changes
- 0 insertions(+), we haven't added or remove anything from the file
- 0 insertions(-), we haven't added or remove anything from the file

Now if we check the status, it says we have nothing to commit
```
$ git status

On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### LOCAL REPOSITORY SETUP
#### 1. Set the name and email for Git to use when you commit
```
$ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

#### 2. Create a directory

#### 3. Initialize directory
```
$ git init
```

#### 4. Create Readme.md file or any file then add to staging area and then commit
```
#staging
$ git add

#local commit
$ git commit
```

Now this is happening locally, we are going to use remote repository ang we are going to use GitHub for that.

### REMOTE REPOSITORY SETUP
#### 1. Create remote repository on
- GitHub, Bitbucket, codecommit etc.

#### 2. Clone Remote Repo to Local 
```
git clone URL
```

#### 3. Or Local to Remote integration
```
$ cd /path/to/local/repo

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git     #OR     ssh://git@github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git

#change branch "master" to "main"
$ git branch -M main

$ git push -u origin main

#to fetch latest changes
$ git pull
```

When you ran the command "$ git remote add origin URL", a new entry (i.e the remote repository path) will be added to the git config file.
```
$ cat .git/config

...
[remote "origin"]
        url = https://github.com/rasheed197/titanwork.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
```

After running the "git push" command, all your changes will be pushed to remote repository, and you should see the directories and files, commit message, and time the push was made.

If you click on a commit message, you should see who made the change, the time, as well as the commit ID

The commit ID id used for versioning.

### MAKE SOME CHANGES IN LOCAL REPO

Edit saturn1.py file
```
$ vim saturn1.py

$ git add saturn1.py
```

Commit the changes
```
$ git commit -m "saturn moons"

Now this commit is done locally, not remotely. We have to push the change to the remote repo
```

```

See all previous commit in the current branch
```
$ git log
